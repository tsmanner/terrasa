The party returns to the K'anchay Chapel with Kask and the body of Caltrop.  When they arrive, Llaska heads down to the chaplain's chambers, telling her what happened and showing her the notes they found in the jeweler's workshop.  Right after he leaves, the party comes in and finds Mayua leafing through the notes.

**Mayua:** This looks like a project journal of some kind, it's full of designs for jewel settings, drawings of gem cuts, and arcane spell notes.  I think it's mostly transmutation and abjuration, though I'm far from an expert on arcane inscription.  I also see definite threads of necromancy throughout it.

Kask explains that he is Caltrop's brother, and tells Mayua about joining them in the workshop.  She welcomes him, and asks if he would like any special handling or particular rituals to be done with Caltrop's body.  Kask only asks that his body be protected from undeath, as he doesn't have any particular faith or tradition for the bodies of the dead.  Mayua says they can handle that, and will inter him in the catacombs beneath the city.

**Mayua:** We need to know more about this, I'll sent it to one of our monasteries for some more information.  It is good you brought this to me, you have done us a service, and I am grateful.  I understand that gratitude alone isn't enough, especially since we haven't worked together for very long.  We appreciate your help, and have this for you.

She reaches into a drawer of her desk, and comes out with a pouch, which she hands to them.

**Mayua:** There's a thousand gold pieces in here, you've made more progress finding information and digging up leads on the cult over the last week or so than we've made in two months.

**Mayua:** Before you go, have you had a chance to look at your journals and quipu?

The party has not yet.

**Mayua:** Well, this will take some time to study, and there is nothing pressing happening right now.  You are welcome to go about your business, and if you spend some time with those journals, come back when you're done.

With that, the party heads back out.  Over the next day or two, they finish their journals, Kask finding some errors and misinterpretations in Caltrop's.  They return to Mayua and are told to join her the following morning to being the final stage of their initiation as associates of the K'anchay Order.

**Mayua:** Good morning, and welcome.  This will require that you demonstrate teamwork, cleverness, and endurance.  Right this way.

She leads them through a door that leads into the catacombs under the city, further beneath the hill this part of the city is built upon.  They descend for a while, and are lead into a dark chamber.  The door closes, leaving them in complete darkness.  After a moment, a few braziers spring to life, lighting the chamber.  It is square, with a stone floor, walls, and ceiling, about forty feet on a side.  On the wall in front of them, is a simple orange door.

The wall to the left is painted with a mural depicting the interior of a large mess hall full of people in simple clothes and robes, some with shaved heads.

The wall behind them is a shoreline of cracked earth, where a ship off shore burns.  A shadowy figure stands with his arm extended, holding a rapier pointed toward a tattooed man with short horns and a wicked grin on his face, the space between them littered with many small tetrahedra spikes.

The wall to their right shows a dense treeline across a meadow, backed by snow-peaked mountains, some wildlife slowly moving, stop-motion, through the frame.  In the center is a large bird of prey, perched on a branch, watching Gluteus.

Each wall has a set of nine levers on it, numbered 1 through 9, all flipped down.  After some discussion, they decide to throw the levers corresponding to the orange strings on their quipu.  Gluteus goes first, quickly throwing all three.  They hear the shifting of stone through the walls afterwords.  Next, Kask throws one lever at a time, waiting a few seconds between each.  As he throws the third one, Gluteus grunts quietly and collapses.

Gromag runs over to him, and Kask notices a small humanoid figure appear in the corner of the room, holding a small bow.  He throws a crowbar at the sprite, which misses, clattering off the wall.  Gromag, seeing this, rushes that direction, jumping first to his right then to his left, springing off the walls, twisting midair and swinging his quarterstaff at the sprite.  The attack connects, and the sprite is flung partway across the room, scattering into a puff of smoke, disappearing.

They shake Gluteus awake, and Gromag throws his levers then pulls the door open.  The next chamber is the same width, but in the darkness, it is hard to tell how long it is.  As Gromag steps through the door, he feels a pulse of magic start to cause his muscles to seize, but due to his monk training and mastery of his body, is able to shrug it off.  To his right, against the wall, he sees a dim flash fade.  He runs that direction, and finds a figure standing there, but misses with two strikes against them.

Kask feels a prick in his side, and poison enter his system.  Turning, he sees a sprite in the room behind him.  As it flies past, into the second chamber, he connects with a strike.  Gromag sees the figure in the room cock their head and grimace a bit, as the blow Kask struck is partially deflected by a sudden magical barrier.  The severely injured sprite zips by, taking a position near the center of the next room.

Gluteus enters, and fires a shot at the figure to the right, which goes wide because he is feeling a little weak from the poisoned arrow that struck him before.  Gromag feels the prick of a tiny arrow, but his halfling stoutness rejects the poison.  Kask steps through the door, and fires a shot from his shortbow at the figure, also narrowly missing.

The battle continues, Gromag eventually succumbing to the poison.  When Gromag rushes away from the figure, connecting on a strike with his fist which destroys the sprite again, Gluteus lands a shot on the figure, staggering her back into the wall.  Kask and Gromag are able to flank her against the wall, scoring some hits back and forth.  The figure fires a bolt of orange-yellow energy back at Gluteus, doing heavy damage to him.

The figure takes Kask down with a rapier strike, and reaches out quickly with her left hand as he falls to stabilize him.  She takes another hit, but manages to also fell Gromag.  Both barely standing, Gluteus and the figure fire at each other, one an arrow, the other a beam of orange-yellow energy.  Arrow narrowly misses, as the beam strikes true, Gluteus falling at the end of a close bout.

The figure then heals each of them in turn a small amount, and introduces herself as Serana, wither her sprite familiar Iva.  There is a very small amount of banter, before she wishes them luck and says "I hope we can do this again some time."

Serana walks to the door to the first chamber, throwing a small lever nearby, which causes braziers along both walls to light up as she walks through.

This room is forty feet wide and about seventy feet long.  The far wall has a single door on it, and the center is dominated by an eight by eight grid of squares, alternating black and white.  Left to right on the floor are the letters "a" through "h" written in green.  On the wall to the left, are the numbers "1" through "9" written in blue.
