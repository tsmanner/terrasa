**Mayua:** We suspect that Wayra and the cult have connections inside the city other than Sayre.  She was able to win a turf war, taking control of the underground, too quickly to have done it alone, even with the help of a necromancer.  Her takeover was brutal, efficient, and quiet; it wasn't clear it was happening until it was almost complete, and even then, it wasn't obvious that the takeover was backed by an outside power.  Llaska has been investigating them for the last few weeks, and while he's good, we could use more help.  Any information you can bring back to us, or cultists you can stop, would be quite valuable to the order.

**Caltrop:** Alright this cult, what're they known for, what information do you have that might help us track them down?

They go outside playing the bagpipes and shouting for "Llaska."  Brother Gromag makes two copper from passersby that say

**Llaska:** I'm hearing lots of things, but whoever these people are, they've been keeping a pretty tight lid on their identities and their goals.  They seem to have a presence in trading and shipping in the region, with the grain laundering and all that.  After what we saw with Sayre, I think there's a major push by the cult into Yalaqta.  To keep it this quiet, they must have some influential contacts in the city.  I'm thinking, probably a politician or two, or who knows, maybe all of 'em!  Hah!

**Llaska:** Every few nights there's an irregularity in the watch patrols near the docks, there are gaps for just a few minutes.  On average it's once, sometimes twice in a week, but never the same amount of time apart and never two nights in a row.

**Caltrop:** When was the last time you saw one?

**Llaska:** It's been a little over a week since I was watching it because of the whole Sayre thing.  Last one I saw was about two weeks ago.

They head down to the docks with Llaska to try and figure out what is up with the patrols and see if they can find anything suspicious. They set up in the Rusty Nail to strategize and keep an eye on some of the docks.  After a few minutes of waiting, Gluteus, Caltrop, and Gromag go outside to take a slightly more active approach.  Gluteus heads down the main dock and starts pretending to mess with some crates and barrels there, trying to draw a guard patrol to him.  Caltrop scopes out the dockside trying to mark all the guards and patrols, and looking for any suspicious activity.  Gromag lays low acting like a harmless drunk in the street near the Rusty Nail, to be ready in case anything goes down.

Gluteus is approached by some guards, who recognize that he's not trying to damage or steal anything.  They assume he's the bird-equivalent of a teenager that's just playing/being rebellious, but not actually harmful.  He tries to incite them a bit but they don't get baited into a real confrontation.  Caltrop approaches, he and Gluteus try to convince the guards that they know the captain of the watch and are supposed to be here.  Caltrop baits them with a line about an "alternate watch" which they basically ignore.  As the guards start to leave, Caltrop starts to say something about the "bagpipe problem" they have, which confuses the guards until Gromag starts playing his in front of the Rusty Nail.  The guards come by and implore him to stop.  Gromag plays the starving musician card, successfully convincing the patrol captain to give him a silver piece to stop, saying that he would love to hear Gromag perform, but this late at night he should be quieter.

After a while, they spot a ship that must have left the dock shortly before they arrived, about 1/2 mile off shore, being approached by a much smaller craft from the east.  The smaller craft pulls up alongside and is lifted onto the larger ship.  It appears to have come from the upper class neighborhood, where the party does remember seeing some small personal docks.

Gluteus flies out to the ship and has a brief confrontation with a man with an ornate scimitar with a rainguard depicting a skull on it, and another man with a longbow.  The man with the scimitar tells him to "get off my ship" and has a brief exchange with Gluteus and the other man, who seems to be the captain of the ship, before Gluteus takes the hint and flies back to the mainland

Caltrop, Gromag, Kilvin, and Llaska head over to the upper class neighborhood to scope out the docks.  Llaska points out that there are a handful of them that are built more sturdily than the rest, with thicker planking and heavier places to tie off a ship.  A couple of them don't have any boats at them, so Caltrop and Kilvin head to one, while Gromag and Llaska head to another.  Gluteus, with some help from Caltrop signaling him with reflected moonlight, eventually finds his way to Caltrop and Kilvin.

Gromag and Llaska are spotted and have a brief interaction with someone that appears to be a mercenary guard, but manage to convince him that they're just friends out for a moonlit walk.

Caltrop, Kilvin, and Gluteus find evidence on the dock of loading and unloading in the form of wear consistent with sliding crates and things around.  They pick up the trail of a cart or something that's leaving faint regular scratches along the ground, and, with Gromag and Llaska in tow, track it to the cellar door at the back of a jewelry shop in the middle class neighborhood, the same area of the city that the Town Hall and Chapel are in.

Caltrop tries to pick the lock, but can't get it to budge.  The party starts to scope out the area and consider their next move.
